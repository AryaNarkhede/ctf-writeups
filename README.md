## How to Write a Good Writeup

A good writeup is more than just a solution; it's a learning tool. It should be clear, concise, and easy to follow. Here are some tips for writing a great writeup:

### Mindset

- **Think like a teacher:** Your writeup should be able to teach someone who has never seen the problem before.
- **Document everything:** Don't skip steps, even if they seem obvious. What's obvious to you might not be to someone else.
- **Explain your thought process:** Why did you run that specific command? What were you looking for? Explaining your reasoning helps others understand the "why" behind your actions.
- **Be honest:** If you went down a rabbit hole, mention it! It's a valuable learning experience for others.

### Structure

A good writeup should have a clear structure. Here's a recommended structure, which is also available as a template in this repository:

1.  **Problem Description:** Start with the original problem description.
2.  **Enumeration:** Detail your initial information gathering. This includes port scans, directory bruteforcing, source code analysis, etc.
3.  **Exploitation:** This is the core of the writeup. Explain the vulnerability and how you exploited it. Include any scripts or payloads you used.
4.  **Post-Exploitation:** Describe what you did after gaining initial access. This includes privilege escalation, pivoting, and finding flags.

### Using the Template

To get started, you can use the `template.md` file in this repository. Simply copy it to a new file and fill in the details.

```bash
cp template.md my-new-writeup.md
```

Happy hacking!
